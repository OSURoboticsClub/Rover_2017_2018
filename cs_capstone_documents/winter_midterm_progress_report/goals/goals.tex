\section{Goals}
The summary of goals for the the Mars Rover Ground Station project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a stable, dual-monitor, full-screen GUI that runs on an Ubuntu 16.04 computer.
\item In the GUI, display video streams, Rover arm joint positions, and status information from the Rover.
\item Also in the GUI, provide a user-interactable map that includes the ability to plot and edit multiple kinds of way-points.
\item Provide control elements to enable the Rover's autonomous mode for the appropriate event during the URC competition.
\item Via various user input devices, allow the user to remotely drive and control the arm on the Rover.
\item Maintain software stability even when radio systems are dropping packets or completely disconnecting and reconnecting.
\item Keep the GUI intuitive enough that the user can focus on performing competition tasks rather than fighting the ground station software.
\item Provide enough documentation so that future Rover years may more easily build off of the code foundation.
\end{itemize}
