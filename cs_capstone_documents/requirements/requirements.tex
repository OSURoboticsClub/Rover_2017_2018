\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to formally define the characteristics of the software to be implemented. 
These requirements can then be used to determine if the software is complete once the project is done, while also serving as a reference during development.


\subsection{Scope}
We will be creating the "Mars Rover Ground Station" software package. 
This software will allow Rover team members to interact with the Oregon State University Robotics Club's Mars Rover for the purpose of a competition taking place in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada during August of 2018. 
The software will provide Rover systems monitoring as well as control of drive and arm systems. 
During competition, the software will be run on a remote base station primarily operated off the back of a truck, allowing users to tele-operate the Rover during manned controlled missions, or to monitor progress during autonomous missions. 
Properly functioning and fully featured ground station software will be a major factor in the success of the Mars Rover during this competition.


\subsection{Definitions / Acronyms / Abbreviations}
\begin{itemize}
\item ROS - Robot Operating System
\item QT - A multi-platform GUI and application framework
\item GPS - Global Positioning Satellite 
\item User - Person operating rover from ground control station
\item GUI - Graphical User Interface
\item RTT - Round-trip Time, the length of time for a signal to be sent plus the length of the time it takes for an acknowledgement of the signal to be received.
\item Bogie - Groups of two individual wheels on the Rover, each with the ability to be driven independently.
\item IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit
\item CAD - Computer Aided Design
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Overview}
The remainder of this document consists of 4 sections and will describe the requirements that must be met in order for this project to be considered fully complete. The next section gives a description of the process. 
The fourth section describes the ground control software's functions, user characteristics, constraints, and assumptions and dependencies. 
The fifth section describes the specific requirements that must be met for the software to be a success.
Finally, stretch goals in the sixth section will describe hopeful, but not mandatory goals for the software.

\section{Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
This project interacts with and requires the Robotics Club's Mars Rover robotics vehicle in order to be useful.
If the Rover is not connected, the software will still be able to launch, but will not perform any useful functions until it has established a connection to the Rover.
In order to accomplish interaction with the rover, the ground station software will use ROS for primary functionality and feedback from the rover.


\section{Product Functions}
The ground control software will primarily accomplish two tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide Rover control to the user.
Direct rover control will be accomplished with joystick(s) and/or a SpaceNav mouse along with a keyboard and mouse.
\item Enable and present rover feedback to the user.
The rover will send health and status information to the ground control station.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{User Characteristics}
Users of the Rover Ground Station software will comprise of Rover team leads and members.

\subsubsection{User Stories}
\begin{itemize}
\item User should be able view ground station UI on two HD monitors so that valuable competition time will not be spent switching between screens on a single monitor
\item User should be able to add way-points because way-points are needed to find useful points in the competition field and are necessary for autonomous navigation
\item User should be able to remove way-points because way-points may become unneeded or need to be reset for a new competition event
\item User should be able to edit way-points because there's a chance that the User may enter way-point details incorrectly and will need to change them
\item User should be able to change the order of way-points because we might need to traverse back to a location, or fix improperly entered way-points
\item User should be able to control the Rover by joystick(s) because that is the preferred way of controlling the Rover  
\item User should be able to select video streams because the Rover has more cameras than can be streamed at any one time, and being able to view any camera on demand will help the User drive the Rover and manipulate the arm
\item User should be able to view the pitch, yaw, roll of the Rover because we want to know if the rover is on an incline, decline, or about to tip over
\item User should be able to switch on and off autonomy because there are competition events that require autonomy and others that require manual control
\item User should be able to tell that autonomy is enabled because that alerts the User that they can no longer manually control the Rover
\item User should be able to view how the arm joints positions as that can show us if the arm is performing correctly
\item User should be able to control the arm because competition events require the use of a Rover arm
\item User should be able to set the Rover speed limit so that the User can more easily drive the Rover over difficult terrain
\item User should be able to view the Rover CPU usage because the User can use this information to tell if there is a software problem on the Rover or if the Rover is trying to process too much information
\item User should be able to view the Rover memory usage because the User does not want the Rover to crash or slow down to unusable levels due to running out of memory
\item User should be able to view the Rover drive usage because the User does not want the Rover to crash if the drive is full
\item User should be able to see the speed of the Rover because it can be used to determine if the Rover is driving at a speed that is reasonable for the current terrain
\item User should be able to see how accurate the GPS positioning is because at the competition there is a requirement to be a certain distance from an object
\item User should be able to see what heading the Rover is at because it allows for the User to know what direction to go
\item User should be able to see the maximum throughput of the network because it will allow for video stream quality to go up or down depending on the connection quality
\item User should be able to confirm connected devices because this will allow for debugging and checking of other connected devices
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Constraints}
Due to the nature of the Mars Rover project, there are multiple hardware and software constraints to ensure that the Ground Station software can properly communicate with the Rover. 
Additionally, the following constraints will help ensure future re-usability of the finalized software, which is a key goal of the Mars Rover team. 
\par
The software language allowed is the primary constraint for this project. 
Python 2.7 is required by the Mars Rover team as it maintains consistency with the software written on the Rover itself. 
The team also requires Python as it more easily allows future team members to reverse engineer code to be reused in future projects.
\par
Use of the QT application framework is another constraint placed by the Rover team in order to facilitate rapid prototyping of the user interface for this project. 
It will also allow for faster and easier modification both by future members of the team, and during competition as that has previously been necessary.
\par
The Rover internally uses ROS to handle routing and interpreting control and status information as well as video data. To be able to view this video data, status information, and to be able to send the Rover control information, this ground station software must also incorporate ROS.
\par
At a hardware level, the Rover team will be providing an Intel NUC desktop computer running Ubuntu 16.04 that the Ground Station software will need to be able to run on.
They will also provide two HD monitors, one or two USB joysticks, a SpaceNav mouse, as well as a keyboard and mouse that will be used to view and interact with the software.
\par
As the Rover project is highly volatile where designs change frequently and hardware development often falls behind, any systems that cannot be explicitly implemented must at least have placeholders in both the GUI frontend and code backend to make eventual development easier when the hardware becomes available.


\section{Specific Requirements}

Upon initial launch, the application should be in full-screen mode across both of the monitors. 
The left-hand screen will show navigation, Rover status, and miscellaneous Rover controls. 
The right hand monitor will show the three live video streams from the Rover. 
In the case that the software is started without a Rover to connect to, the software will display as-such and show placeholder information until such a connection is made.
