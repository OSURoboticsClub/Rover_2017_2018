\subsubsection{Technical Knowledge Gained}
\begin{itemize}
\item Real-world ROS usage
\item Multi-monitor PyQt interfaces
\item Some nuances of low-bandwidth networking
\item Multiple video steam coordination
\item Better organization of large software projects
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Technical Knowledge Gained}
\begin{itemize}
\item Better project time management skills
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Knowledge Gained of Project Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Projects almost always take longer than expected
\item Requirements almost always change, even if only a little bit
\item Lack of proper organization can make working on a project near impossible
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Knowledge Gained of Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scheduling times to do things like project work where everyone can show up can be difficult
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Knowledge Gained of Working in Teams}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continuous communication makes working in teams much much easier
\item So long as everyone is on the same page teams can get as much done when in the same room as they can separately
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Changes to Make if Starting Over}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make better plans at the beginning for handling delays in the Rover side of the project
\item Work out a more empirical way of testing how much bandwidth is needed / can be handled by the radio links so we would have known what we had to work with
\end{itemize}
