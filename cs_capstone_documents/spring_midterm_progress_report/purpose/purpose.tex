\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this project is to create ground station control software that will interface with the OSU Robotics Club's Mars Rover.
This software will take in controls via user input devices such as joysticks, a SpaceNav mouse, as well as traditional keyboard and mouse in order to send remote control commands.
These commands will allow a user to drive the Rover and control the Rover arm.
Additionally, this software will allow for viewing of video streams and status information being sent back to the ground station from the Rover.
The point of writing this software is to complete the package that is the Mars Rover competition robot so that it may compete in the University Rover Challenge taking place in June of 2018.
