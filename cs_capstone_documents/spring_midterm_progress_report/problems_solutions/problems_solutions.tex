\subsection{Mars Rover Team Development Progress}
As the Mars Rover project is a very large multi-disciplinary project run by undergraduate volunteers, the team has historically had problems with being behind schedule, and this year is no different. The team lost their electrical lead fall term and has been catching up since the team lead, Nick McComb, took over this position. This, plus normal delays in development have meant that many of the core systems that the capstone team needs to test against are not present, not ready to interact with in their current state, or in a few cases still in a research state. Corwin has attempted to alleviate some of this by helping assemble hardware for the electrical team and prioritizing some ground station development time for the Rover systems themselves. In addendum, some time was put into working with the Arm team in trying to fix their software issues, in addition to part delays.
