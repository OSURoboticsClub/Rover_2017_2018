# IRIS Node

Designed by [Nick McComb](www.nickmccomb.net) for OSURC Mars Rover.


## Summary

Made for MR1718 as part of the OSU Robotics Club.

Enables a single USB port to act as 10 RS485 Transceivers, receive inputs from an S.BUS style RC receiver, and interface with a few switches. Input power is 24V (self powered, no power is drawn from the USB connection). Features a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller.

This design is entirely Open Source and is available on CircuitMaker, see below for a link to the file.

This is a 4-layer design.

The name "Iris" comes from the greek messenger god, [Iris](http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Iris.html). This is the board that acts as a "messenger god" for our computer, telling the rest of the robot what to do.

### Known Issues

#### Version 1
- Used CAN tx/rx instead of hardware UART
- Connections from FTDI to RS485 transceiver wrong, need to short DE / RE pins together, then this connection goes to FTDI enable. PWREN for the RS485 converted is wrong naming and doesnâ€™t reflect its purpose. No connection to PWREN on 4232 needed...
- Missing 3v3 rail connection to VBAT pin on Teensy. Will program without it, but will not boot without it.
- For R46 vs R47 selection, only R47 is needed.
- No invert needed for S.BUS connection (bridge pins)
- No serial number spot on silkscreen
- No MODBUS ID number spot on silkscreen
- Likely that this should use a high-speed USB hub instead of the current full-speed implementation. It is easy, without deliberate planning, to hit the bottleneck of the USB hub.
- Remove GND connection for RS485 going out of the board (to ensure reverse protection downstream)

#### Version 2
- U8_7 pin 1 silkscreen dot not visible 
- R1 silkscreen not visible
