# Tower Alt

![Tower Alt Render](files/tower_alt_render.png)

Designed by [Nick McComb](www.nickmccomb.net) for OSURC Mars Rover.


## Summary

Made for MR1718 as part of the OSU Robotics Club.

This board acts as an alternate for Rover's [Tower Node](tower.md)Â when both of the boards we had didn't work. It really just breaks out a Teensy 3.2 to a few different connectors.
