### Known Issues

#### Version 1
- Missing 3v3 rail connection to VBAT pin on Teensy. Will program without it, but will not boot without it.
- 12V switching supply GND is not connected to board GND.
- Motor controller needs a thermal pad in the footprint, will not work otherwise because thermal pad is connected to GND. Scrape away silkscreen below package before soldering.
- Motors 2-4 are still not working...
- LED needs to be rotated 90 deg CCW for power pin to line up.
